# Sem03-PlatformBasedDevelopment

### Course Overview
This repository contains assignments from the **Platform-Based Development** course taken in my third semester. The course focused on front-end web development with HTML and CSS, backend connectivity, and Android app development. Through these projects, I gained practical experience in creating full-stack web applications and developing basic Android applications.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout this course, I developed skills in:
- Designing and implementing web applications using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**.
- Building and managing backend databases with **PostgreSQL** and **Node.js** for server-side logic.
- Basic Android application development with **Android Studio**, emphasizing dynamic interfaces and interaction.

### Project and Assignments

#### 1. Persistence Laboratory: Priority 2.0
- **Description**: This assignment involved creating an online health management system that integrates front-end and back-end development. The primary focus was establishing connectivity between the backend and frontend layers, ensuring data persistence and a functional UI for users.
- **Project Requirements**:
  - **Backend**: Built with **Node.js** (or optionally Nginx and PHP) to manage server and backend operations.
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL was required for data persistence.
  - **Frontend**: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with recommendations to use Bootstrap and JQuery for enhanced functionality and design.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Authentication**: Log in/out and user authentication for physicians and administrators.
  - **Physician Management**: Administrators can create, edit, and delete physician accounts.
  - **Patient Management**: Physicians can add, edit, and delete patients, view their patient list, and filter or search for specific patients.
  - **Error Handling**: Appropriate error messages are shown for issues such as incorrect username or password entries.
- **Additional Documentation**: A detailed README with project specifications, requirements, and the groupâ€™s grade is included in the `Persistence-laboratory-priority-2-0` directory.
- **Demo video**: Youtube URL: Frontend:https://youtu.be/uTut8CMRG6g Backend: https://youtu.be/zu0B0Lh38Lg

#### 2. Dynamic Android Application
- **Description**: This project involved creating a dynamic Android app using **Android Studio**. Although due to version updates, the app is currently inoperable, this assignment helped build a foundation in Android app development.
- **Tools Used**: Android Studio for development, with a focus on creating a responsive and interactive interface.

### Usage Instructions
For the **Persistence Laboratory** project:
1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Set up Node.js and PostgreSQL. Follow the instructions in the specific README located within the `Persistence-laboratory-priority-2-0` folder.
2. **Frontend**:
   - Open `login_page.html` in a browser to test the interface (ensure the backend server is running).
3. **Android App**:
   - This project is currently not operable due to version compatibility issues with Android Studio.
